### **README: Student Course Management System using SQL Server**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project is a simple **Student Course Management System** built using **SQL Server**. The system manages students, courses, instructors, and enrollments, with queries to handle basic and advanced operations such as data insertion, updates, deletions, and reports. This README file will guide you from installing SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to executing the final project queries.
